# Introduction

The Tick System is a custom replacement for traditional initiative and
turn order in D&D 5e, designed to reward speedsters, reflect a hierarchy
of power, and enhance player agency through real-time decision-making.
Instead of fixed turn cycles, characters gain Speed Points (SP) every
"tick" based on their Speed Modifier. When enough SP is accumulated,
characters may spend them to act. This enables fluid, asynchronous
combat and better showcases the pacing and tension of high fantasy
battles.

# Core Concepts

## Ticks

-   Ticks represent units of time in combat.
-   At the beginning of each tick, all combatants gain SP equal to their
    Tick Rate (base 10 + Speed Modifier).
-   A combatant may act once they have enough SP to pay the cost of an
    action.

## Speed Points (SP)

-   Each character has a Speed Pool, the amount of SP they can store
    (default: 100).
-   **SP costs:**
    -   Standard Action: 70 SP
    -   Bonus Action: 30 SP
    -   Reaction: 30--50 SP (varies)
    -   Movement: Still deciding, maybe 1 SP per foot.
-   SP may be saved across ticks.

## Speed Modifiers

-   Derived from Dexterity, feats, class features, and spells.
-   Example Speed Mod calculation: (Dex Modifier + Class Bonus + Feat
    Bonus)
-   Minimum Tick Rate: 1 (even slow creatures act eventually)
-   **Haste/Slow effects:**
    -   Haste: +10 SP per tick
    -   Slow: -10 SP per tick

# Acting in Combat

-   Characters act when they choose, provided they have the SP to pay
    for it.
-   SP may be spent immediately upon reaching the required threshold.
-   Players may choose to wait, store SP, or react defensively.
-   SP caps at Speed Pool maximum (default: 100). Unused SP beyond that
    is lost unless otherwise noted.

# Class and Role Adaptation

-   Rogues, monks, and dex-based classes will act more often. Barbarians
    and fighters act less frequently but can unleash devastating effects
    when they do.

## Class Customizations

-   **Barbarian:** Attacks cost 50 SP while raging.
-   **Fighter:** Speed Pool increases to 150.
-   **Rogue and Monk:** Bonus Actions cost 20 SP.

# Reactions

-   May be triggered between ticks or during other creatures' turns.
-   Cost 30--50 SP depending on effect.
-   **Examples:**
    -   Opportunity Attack: 30 SP
    -   Sentinel Strike: 30 SP
    -   Shield Spell: 50 SP

# Legendary Creatures & SP

-   Bosses gain SP per player turn (e.g., +15 SP when any player acts).
-   May act multiple times per round via Legendary Actions:
    -   Wing Buffet: 20 SP
    -   Tail Swipe: 15 SP
    -   Dragon Breath: 70 SP (Full Action)
-   Enables high-level enemies to remain threatening in an open tick
    loop.

# Advanced Customization

## Feats & Upgrades

-   **Quickened Soul:** +5 SP per tick
-   **Warrior's Reserve:** Speed Pool cap +50
-   **Overdrive:** Once per long rest, spend 140 SP to take two full
    actions
-   **Tickstep:** When an enemy acts, gain +7 SP

## Spell Interaction

-   **Haste:** Grants +5 SP per tick, doubles Speed Pool cap for 1
    minute
-   **Slow:** Subtracts 5 SP per tick, halves Speed Pool cap

## Optional: Movement Ticks

-   **Dash:** 40 SP for double movement
-   **Teleportation spells:** retain normal spell SP cost

# Player Strategy

Players must weigh: - Whether to spend SP now or build up for a powerful
combo - Whether to hold SP for a reaction - Whether to act defensively
or aggressively

This creates layered combat where every tick is a chance to shift the
battlefield.

# Tracking Tools

-   Dedicated tick manager tool (coming soon) to monitor SP pools and
    tick progression.

# Conclusion

The Tick System empowers narrative pacing, visualizes power hierarchies,
and breaks the static turn-based mold. It invites faster characters to
shine, strategists to thrive, and epic monsters to feel truly
overwhelming.
